            	 <text>At the time of its launch, the print series was a phenomenal success driven in part by widespread Japanese devotion to Mount Fuji as a sacred site of pilgrimage and worship. Demand for the prints spurred Hokusai’s publisher to reprint the most popular designs and expand the series by 10, bringing the total number of prints in the series to 46.

Mount Fuji was an ideal subject for Hokusai to explore—a beloved backdrop to daily life in the bustling city of Edo (modern Tokyo)—a place that possessed a sense of innate power and sacred meaning. It enabled him to apply a lifetime of artistic ideas and experience to a subject that loomed large in the public’s imagination. The series established landscape as a new subject for Japanese prints, which had previously focused on courtesans and kabuki actors.

By the time he began work on the Mount Fuji series in the mid-1820s, Hokusai was a famous and respected artist who had studied and absorbed not only Japanese but also Chinese and European artistic traditions. After decades of work and tens of thousands of images produced as a print designer, book illustrator and painter, the Mount Fuji series marked his return into the competitive world of inexpensive single sheet prints.

“Hokusai had passed the age of 70 when he created the series, but he felt that he had just arrived at the beginning of his artistic maturation,” said Ann Yonemura, curator of Japanese art. “It’s possible that he was drawn to Mount Fuji as a subject for its association with longevity. He had a fervent wish to become 110. By that time, he once wrote, every dot and line that he made would be alive. He believed that if he were to be blessed with a long life of at least 100 years, his art would become divine.”

Hokusai had studied landscape styles and experimented with composition, color, light, space and atmosphere for decades before he began work on the series, often incorporating striking landscapes into commissioned surimono (woodblock) prints and books of poetry, illustrated books and paintings.

Each image in the series reflects his vast knowledge of artistic styles, including classical and contemporary Japanese, Chinese and European. Hokusai took delight in incorporating Western ideas into his work: transitions between near and distant scenes and the use of framing devices that echo Mount Fuji’s triangular form in rooflines and in foregrounds.

Hokusai was also a supreme observer of the natural environment. The artist frequently depicted transient effects such as breaking waves, mist rising from a river, wind, how color is perceived at dawn and light reflecting from clouds.

“Hokusai expresses these observations in a very consciously artistic arrangement of line and color composition,” said Yonemura. “His genius is really about that remarkable combination of observation of natural phenomena and meticulous attention to arrangement of pattern and color that can’t be seen in the work of any other artist in Japan during his time.”
