               <text>Collected in Democratic Republic of the Congo; probably from Angola. In Chokwe villages masks are worn by men in dances to invoke ancestral spirits, to represent spirits found in nature, or to represent men and women or wild animals in a narrative story. The original Chokwe name (pwo) referred to an adult woman who had given birth. The more recent name, mwana pwo, probably adopted under European influence, emphasizes youthful, feminine beauty.</text>

               <text> This mask represents a beautiful young woman adorned with tattoos, earrings and an elaborate coiffure. The original Chokwe name (pwo) referred to an adult woman who had given birth. The more recent name, mwana pwo, probably adopted under European influence, emphasizes youthful, feminine beauty. The artist carved this mask with very delicate, even, thin walls from the wood of Alstonia (probably A. congensis). The surface is a rich, reddish brown color, probably obtained from a mixture of red clay and oil, and has a beautiful patina, a sign of long use. The half-closed eyes placed in large, concave sockets are covered with white clay (kaolin). The eyes, slender nose, elliptical mouth and hemispherical ears are delicately carved on a face delineated by a softly modeled forehead and concave chin. The major components of the fiber coiffure are a braided headband and a heavy fringe at the rear. Chokwe women typically wore a hairstyle entirely coated with red earth and known as tota. Description: Dark brown oval shaped female face mask with a broad forehead. The eyes are horizontal slits placed within large eye sockets coated with white pigment, the nose is long with pierced nostrils and the mouth is long and cut horizontally to form the lips. The back of the head is covered with a knotted, corded fiber coiffure.</text>

The major components of the fiber coiffure are a braided headband and a heavy fringe at the rear. Chokwe women typically wore a hairstyle entirely coated with red earth and known as tota. The artist carved several different representations of tattoos on the mask. On the left cheek and forehead are the triangles of the tattoo known as cingelyengelye. Originally, cingelyengelye occurred as a necklace in the form of a cross, cut from tin plate and worn by the Chokwe as an amulet. During the 17th century, Capuchin monks from the Order of Christ of Portugal had distributed medals in the form of a cross throughout Chokwe country, and this cross was probably the prototype for cingelyengelye. On the right cheek of the mask is the tattoo known as cijingo, in combination with a cross. Cijingo denotes a spiral brass bracelet. On the forehead and extending to the temples is the tattoo known as mitelumuna, or "knitted eyebrows," an allusion to discontentedness or arrogance. Under the eyes are tattoos known as masoji, signifying tears. Pwo or mwana pwo is one the most popular dancing masks among the Chokwe. Because they follow matrilineal descent, the Chokwe dance pwo to honor the founding female ancestor of the lineage. A male dancer is dressed like a woman in a costume of braided fiber that completely covers his body and hides his identity. He wears a loincloth, carries a fan and moves in slow, precise steps to emulate a woman. When the mask becomes unusable, it is discarded. When a masquerader dies, the mask is buried with the dancer.</text>
